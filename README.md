CEG Infoconnect is a website which provides a better connectivity among staff, departments and students. It offers forums using which sending informations to students and staffs is relatively easy and quick. Students can shoot out their questions using the forum and staffs corresponding the subject will be notified. Students of each class and staffs can make use of the chat feature to communicate among themselves.

Complete refactoring of the code is being done by using Ruby on rails.I will link to the code once the project is over. Any query, u can contact me through <a href="mailto:aadi1194@gmail.com?Subject=CEG%20InfoConnect%20Query" target="_blank">my mail id</a>.
